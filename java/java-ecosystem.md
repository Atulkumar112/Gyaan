## JDK (Java Development Kit)
Purpose: The JDK is a software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes tools needed to compile, debug, and execute Java programs.
Components: It contains the JRE (Java Runtime Environment), an assortment of development tools (like the Java compiler javac), and libraries required to develop Java applications.
Usage: If you're a developer working on Java projects, you need the JDK to write and compile your code.

## JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
Purpose: The JRE is the runtime environment that allows Java applications to run. It provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run Java applications.
Components: It includes the JVM, core libraries, and other supporting files. However, it does not include development tools such as compilers or debuggers.
Usage: End-users who just want to run Java applications need the JRE. Developers use it indirectly since it's included in the JDK.

## JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
Purpose: The JVM is a virtual machine that runs Java bytecode and provides a runtime environment for Java applications. It abstracts the underlying hardware and operating system, enabling Java programs to be platform-independent.
Components: It includes a set of instructions for executing Java bytecode and manages memory and other system resources.
Usage: The JVM is crucial for running Java programs. It is part of both the JRE and JDK.

## SDK (Software Development Kit)
Purpose: An SDK is a broader term that refers to a collection of software development tools. While the JDK is a specific SDK for Java, the term SDK generally applies to development kits for various platforms and programming languages.
Components: An SDK typically includes APIs, development tools, libraries, documentation, and sometimes even sample code.
Usage: If you're working on developing software for a specific platform or language, you would use an SDK tailored for that environment. For Java, the JDK serves as the SDK.
